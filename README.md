# Sear Me Out
 Sear Me Out is a full-stack application that lets users add and view recipes. It enables the user to have all their recipes in one place. This tool takes a collection of recipes and turns it into a lightweight website for your personal use as a reference while cooking, or for sharing with family and friends. The user creates a profile and add the recipes from the profile page. The user can also view other recipes posted by other users on the main page. 

# Motivation
Our teams motivation for creating this app was having recipes saved in many places and wanting them all in one place. For example, having 100s of recipe websites booked marked, saved on tiktok, instagram, and facebook, and written down.
